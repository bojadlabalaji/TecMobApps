# Pomodoro Web App

This is a fully customizable **Pomodoro Timer** web app designed to boost productivity using the Pomodoro technique. The app features customizable work/break intervals, iteration tracking, and dynamic animations to keep users engaged during their work sessions.

- **Dynamic GIF Animations**: Visual feedback based on the timer state
- **Circular Progress Bar**: Around the GIF area to visually represent the remaining time in each work/break session.
- **Iteration Indicator**: Shows completed and pending Pomodoro sessions using circular tick marks, with completed iterations highlighted.
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for mobile and desktop screens.
- **Color Scheme**: Follows the 70-20-10 design rule to ensure a visually balanced UI.
